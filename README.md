# Resume
My Azure Resume Project - Duval Le Blanc. 
This will be a Cloud Resume Challenge that was designed on Azure. 
The Idea is From MadebyGPS's Azure Resume Project

Idea
The Project is a Static Website that will be Hosted on Azure Blob Storage.

$Cost
This means that the site will have an OPEX cost. I will try to go with the least costing but
efficient storage services to house the site.

<>Code
The environment says it will be in a DevContainer.
The website will be built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
There will be a Visitor Count that will be built in with .NET and Azure Functions. 

Front End - Website | 
BackEnd - API/Azure Functions
