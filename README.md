# Azure-Resume
My Azure Resume Project - Started 12/11
This will be a Cloud Resume Challenge that was designed on Azure. 
The Idea is From MadebyGPS's Azure Resume Project

Idea
The Project is a Static Website that will be Hosted on Azure Storage.

$Cost
This means that the site will have an OPEX cost. I will try to go with the least costing but
efficient storage services to house the site.

Code
The website will be built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It appears that from MadebyBPS description that there will be a Visitor Count that will be 
built in with .NET and Azure Functions. This will give me good exposure to .NET and Azure Functions 
with the Cloud
