# Azure Cloud Website
My Azure Cloud Website Project - Duval Le Blanc. 
This will be a Cloud Website Challenge that was designed on Azure. 
The Idea is From MadebyGPS's Azure Resume Project. I removed a lot of the backend API side and stripped it down to just be a static site
without the need for Azure Functions, Core Tools, CosmosDB, and all the API side. I just wanted to deploy a static website through Azure as a Project. 

Idea
The Project is a Static Website that will be Hosted on Azure Blob Storage.

$Cost
This means that the site will have an OPEX cost. I will try to go with the least costing but
efficient storage services to house the site.

<>Code
Javascript, CSS, HTML

Front End - Website Files, css, javascript, html
