# Azure Cloud Static Webpage
This is a static webpage that is completely contained within Azure Blog Storage.

The Idea is From MadebyGPS's Azure Resume Project. I removed a lot of the backend API side and stripped it down to just be a static site
without the need for Azure Functions, Core Tools, CosmosDB, and all the API side. I just wanted to deploy a static website through Azure as a Project. 
In the Future I would like to add the API backend but for now I just wanted to make an Azure Cloud Static Webpage that would contain my Resume.

There is an OPEX cost of around $2-3 per month from my last invoice but it may be subject to change so I will keep a record of the payments.
