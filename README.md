# Resume
My Azure Resume Project - Started 12/11
This will be a Cloud Resume Challenge that was designed on Azure. 
The Idea is From MadebyGPS's Azure Resume Project

Idea
The Project is a Static Website that will be Hosted on Azure Storage.

$Cost
This means that the site will have an OPEX cost. I will try to go with the least costing but
efficient storage services to house the site.

Code
The environment says it will be in a DevContainer. I'm not familiar with what DevContainers are but I will 
research what it is. It seems to be a Containerized environment that allows you to code in...?
The website will be built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It appears that from MadebyBPS description that there will be a Visitor Count that will be 
built in with .NET and Azure Functions. This will give me good exposure to .NET and Azure Functions 
with the Cloud

Front End - Website
BackEnd - API/Azure Functions
